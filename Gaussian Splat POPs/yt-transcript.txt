Hi there everyone and welcome to another 
 touch designer tutorial. Today we're 
 going to look at gouge and splatting 
 using the new pop family. I'm going to 
 preface this tutorial by saying that I 
 am using the experimental release 
 202531310 
 which was released just a couple of days 
 ago. I'm using it on a Mac but it should 
 also work on a PC. And what's really 
 great about this release is as we get 
 closer to having a stable release, we're 
 getting a lot of updates that are really 
 great. Um, I haven't been able to get 
 gouge and splats running super stably 
 using pops up to this point. So, this 
 has worked a lot more stably and 
 effective for me, which I'm super happy 
 about. And what we're going to do today 
 is go through the gaus and splat 
 component as well as looking into some 
 of the guts of this. I'm going to make 
 this base file where you can just load 
 and look at Gaus and Splats available 
 for free on my Patreon. You just have to 
 sign up to be a free member and there'll 
 be some added extras where we actually 
 manipulate the guts which will be 
 available on the component tier. So, 
 let's start out by looking at the 
 gausian splat component. 
 And this is a component that has been 
 modified from that original Tim 
 Garrettson component to work in TOPS. It 
 was made available via Touch Designer as 
 part of their beta example package. And 
 I've made some additions as well, which 
 we can see here in this additional 
 parameters. 
 So starting out, we have the basic 
 stuff. We have the render resolution. We 
 also have this gausian splat.pl. 
 So, this is where we load in a ply file. 
 Let's do another 
 image. And we can see that that is 
 loading in really quickly, which is 
 great. 
 We can see that there's some cropping 
 going on here as well, which we'll sort 
 out later. But for now, I'll backtrack 
 to my older file. So, it's really nice 
 and quick moving between gouge and splat 
 files. we have this ability to switch 
 between a ply format and an SPZ format. 
 So this gives us the ability to load in 
 different types of files. So we can do 
 SPZ or PLY depending on your preference 
 there. So that's a useful update if 
 you're using different types of files. 
 Again, back to the PLY. 
 And we also have this reload. So 
 basically, if you're loading in 
 something that's not loaded, right, you 
 can just click that pulse. It should 
 reload that file. We can turn on and off 
 our auto sort. So this should all just 
 be kind of left as is by default. On top 
 of that, we have translate. 
 So that will translate our point cloud 
 in 3D space 
 and rotation. 
 So, we can rotate as well. I have this 
 set up with a camera viewport. So, we 
 can also just rotate and hold middle 
 mouse to zoom in and out and right click 
 and drag to drag around. 
 We also can control the uniform scale. 
 So how big our point cloud is the splat 
 size. So how big each of these 
 individual splats are. So basically look 
 at this. It's a point right now. And as 
 I bring that up, it becomes more and 
 more elongated in that classic splat 
 shape. 
 And we have our alpha threshold. And 
 this allows us to change the alpha 
 blend. And we can see that things become 
 a lot more harsh as we move in. So 
 that's kind of a nice 
 little slider to have there as well. 
 The additions that I have made are down 
 here. As we know, gouge and splat files 
 can be quite intensive on our machines. 
 So I have this thin random added in. So 
 this basically allows us to kind of 
 randomly sample our point clouds so 
 we're not kind of crashing our computer 
 if we have massive massive point clouds. 
 And we can go really really sparse or we 
 can go and have everything there. I've 
 also set up this boundary delete. So we 
 can see here that basically everything 
 is cropped outside of that certain 
 boundary. I'm using a length parameter 
 to basically crop everything that's 
 above a certain distance. And what we 
 can do here is we can change this. So as 
 I move this, we see more or less of that 
 gouge and splat. It's basically a way of 
 just cropping it. So we're kind of 
 seeing the useful parts that we actually 
 want to see. And on top of that, I have 
 this boundary center. So this is going 
 to define where the center of that 
 boundary is. So basically that central 
 point is what will get the distance 
 around and delete outside of that 
 boundary. So let's move this around. We 
 can see that that boundary is moving. 
 This is going to move this up and down. 
 So we can see it kind of scans through 
 the shape. So we want that normally at 
 zero for the Y. But for these ones, 
 for the Z and the X, it will move it 
 left and right. And then you can 
 position that to whatever makes sense 
 for you. 
 Bring that down. And I want this to be 
 centered. 
 That looks more or less right. 
 No, far off. Sometimes I find these 
 angles can be weird. 
 Okay. 
 Not going to be forensic about that, but 
 that's that's pretty good. So, these are 
 the options that you have for working 
 with gouge and splats just through this 
 component in this example file. And I'm 
 going to make this example file 
 available for free on my Patreon. You 
 just have to subscribe as a free member. 
 Let's go inside and take a look at how 
 we can make this do some more 
 interesting things. 
 This is the guts of the component. So 
 this is essentially an earlier pipeline 
 that now isn't used for getting the data 
 from polycam and displaying that. But 
 basically what we have here is we have 
 our point file in we're putting a bunch 
 of stuff together into these attributes 
 and then we're visualizing it down the 
 line here using this gouge and splat 
 GLSL vertex shader. And basically what 
 we're putting in in terms of the visual 
 is this point cloud with a bunch of 
 attributes attached. And we can see what 
 those attributes are. Let's take that 
 into a pop to that. 
 And so we can see we've got our color, 
 our length which is added by me, the 
 rotation and the scale. So quite sparse 
 when you actually think about all the 
 data that is attached to a gaus and 
 splat initially. 
 We can see here that we have all of 
 these fields that we could be working 
 with. So the touch designer team have 
 done some great work making this much 
 more streamlined and we can see that all 
 this stuff has been running pretty fast 
 on my machine about 50 to 60 fps which 
 is great. 
 This is the section where we actually 
 can make changes. So, we're basically 
 looking to make changes in this section 
 here where everything has been defined 
 and is being output. And we're basically 
 just making changes on the end display. 
 And what I've got here is I've got my 
 delete. And so that delete has been 
 paired with a math mix. This is one of 
 my favorite kind of little tricks in 
 touch designer. So in my math mix, I set 
 my central point in the uniform section 
 as a float three. So I've got my XYZ for 
 my central point. And then I perform a 
 subtraction operation. So I take that 
 center away from the position. So that 
 central point is going to subtract the 
 position of each individual point. And 
 that's going to give me the beginning of 
 my length. And then I'm going to use a 
 length operation to access the length. 
 And what this really means is that it 
 gives me a value for each point in terms 
 of how far away it is from my central 
 area that I've defined. So we can see 
 here that we have this very clear 
 boundary. And that's basically anything 
 that is over that distance that we've 
 defined is going to be deleted. And that 
 just allows us to pop that into a 
 delete. And right here we can see we've 
 got the larger than operation. And if I 
 flip this around, we can see that 
 instead of having the center shown, 
 we're cutting out the center. So, this 
 is a really handy little trick that I 
 use all the time for deleting things 
 that are outside of a certain boundary 
 or even just making things have a kind 
 of a ramp element away from the center. 
 So, I find this to be a very useful 
 little kind of um touch designer pop 
 trick with this math mix to get the 
 length and then the delete. What we can 
 also see is I have this section here 
 which has a bunch of stuff going on 
 inside that I've kind of encapsulated 
 for just making this a bit easier to 
 look at. And if I add that to my cooking 
 window and connect that up there, we can 
 see that I'm adding in a couple things 
 here. So, we're adding in some noise, 
 but we can also add in a trail. And 
 what's really fun about this is the 
 trail is actually going to be rendered 
 by the gaus and splat renderer. And it's 
 already got all the attributes of each 
 of these splats. Um, but it will then 
 just render that as a trail or a copied 
 series of particles. And I really like 
 this effect where it's sort of the 
 hybrid with the gouge and splat and 
 these sort of ephemeral trails. Let's go 
 into this base and I'm just going to 
 delete all of this stuff 
 and we're going to build some stuff from 
 scratch. 
 Because we're working with sort of 
 largeish point clouds, we're going to 
 have to add in quite a lot of noise to 
 sort of see a difference. So let's move 
 that up to around one. And let's turn 
 that period up something high like five 
 or seven. 
 Can fiddle with that exponent. 
 And even turn up the noise to something 
 like two even higher than one. 
 If we animate it with our old favorite 
 command absime docs times 0.1 
 we can see that we are animating the 
 noise 
 and I'm even going to make this 
 bigger because it's a very big file and 
 then you get this sort of nice noise 
 displacement effect. 
 So that's an early stage very simple 
 technique that you can do. Other things 
 that are equally simple but also 
 effective are you can add in a twist. I 
 really like this effect on a point cloud 
 like this. 
 So with the twist you can play with the 
 strength, 
 can play with the rolloff and you can 
 change the axes that you're applying 
 that to. The y- axis is quite fun 
 because that twirls it around the 
 central point. And we can also change if 
 we're bending it, if we're adding in 
 these different um types of controls, 
 although not all of them work. Twist is 
 very robust 
 and that's a really nice effect. You can 
 also play with this pivot to change 
 various factors and consider animating 
 these using LFOs or abs time do seconds. 
 I'm going to bring this down so it's 
 very very minimal. And with all of these 
 techniques, something that's worth 
 trying out is adding in a feedback loop. 
 And what this will allow us to do is to 
 basically create small changes to our 
 system and then add that iteratively. So 
 the feedback loop is going to be the sum 
 of all its parts here. So, we can't 
 really see that twist, but if we add in 
 a null and drag that back onto the 
 feedback, 
 turn up this twist value, 
 we see that we have this sort of 
 twirling whirlwind made out of all of 
 our points 
 and press start. And we'll keep that 
 going. 
 We're going to add in a keyboard in 
 bring that up to start. So now whenever 
 we press that, it's going to reset that 
 feedback loop. 
 Something else I really like to do is I 
 like to mix between multiple inputs in 
 this feedback. And this allows it to 
 have some of the initial signal coming 
 through as well. To do that, I'm going 
 to add in a math mix. 
 I'm going to set the operation to mix 
 ABC and I'm going to take the in. So 
 basically the unprocessed signal and I'm 
 going to put that in my second inlet of 
 the math mix. And now what I'm going to 
 do is I'm going to say P is my scope A 
 input 
 in 1 P is my scope B input. And then for 
 the time being we can define a value. So 
 zero is going to be the processed 
 version and one is going to be the 
 unprocessed version and as you move down 
 you will start getting 
 stronger and stronger versions. So you 
 have to go really low to really see that 
 start coming through because obviously 
 the feedback loop is this iterative 
 process. So when we are adding stuff 
 that is closer to the original signal 
 it's going to take its Q from that. 
 So, what we want to do rather than 
 having a static value is add in 
 something that's going to be calculated 
 for each point. And this could be 
 anything you like, but in this instance, 
 I'm going to go for something really 
 simple and add in a pattern. 
 We're going to see something's happening 
 right off the bat. Not ideal. What I'm 
 going to do is change my output 
 attribute scope to mix. 
 We can see it goes back to its original 
 form. And under this math mix, I can go 
 in here and choose in one mix as my 
 scope C. 
 Okay. 
 And now let's tweak this a little bit. 
 When we're working with sign curves, 
 just make sure that the map low to high 
 is minus one to one. 
 And let's animate that phase. 
 Let's play a bit more to make this more 
 exciting. 
 Slower is always good. 
 And let's actually change this high 
 point. 
 There we go. 
 So this is something where you can just 
 start being creative. You could also add 
 in say 
 more obvious twisting. 
 Okay, we have an effect here. It's not 
 particularly finessed, but this gives 
 you the idea of what we can do as we 
 start playing with these different mix 
 modes. Something else we could do is 
 instead of a pattern, we could add in a 
 noise. 
 And I'm going to use in my scope C, I'll 
 just use noise in one noise. 
 Once the noise is added, I'm going to 
 turn my offset up to one. And then we 
 can start playing with that amplitude 
 value. 
 Remember that one is our unprocessed 
 point cloud and anything less than one 
 is mixing towards that zero value which 
 is our processed point cloud. And 
 if we turn down that offset a little 
 bit, we can add in some animation to the 
 transform. 
 And let's change the period on that 
 noise. That's nice. 
 Oh yeah, that's a much nicer effect. 
 Let's even change that period up to 12. 
 turn down those harmonics. 
 And instead of the twist, what we could 
 do is we could add in a noise that's 
 just going to displace the point cloud. 
 So, we're going to turn up the noise 
 value 
 and we're going to turn up the period. 
 So, then this is just allowing certain 
 segments through 
 based on this noise value here. 
 And as we turn this up and this down, it 
 can become more noisy. So this is a nice 
 way of kind of controlling what elements 
 of your sketch are going to be sort of 
 highlighted for these manipulations. 
 And if you fancy it, you can also just 
 add back that twist. Or actually, we 
 already have that twist. So, we can do 
 that, but having it a little bit lower 
 or even changing the axes. 
 And this allows you to have something 
 that you can be really, really creative 
 with. 
 Apologies, my screen capture just died, 
 so I'm restarting it. But basically, the 
 gist of this is we can just use these 
 pop operations to essentially play 
 around. And really, really simply here, 
 we're not doing anything fancy. We're 
 just mixing with a a value here. So, it 
 could be a static value that you put in. 
 Remember that zero is our 
 processed kind of affected signal. So 
 it's looking really crazy because we've 
 put in some pretty big values there. And 
 the closer we are to one, we're getting 
 to our unprocessed signal. But what 
 we're doing by putting in a secondary 
 signal, so like this in one noise, is 
 we're allowing 
 these signals to sort of meld between 
 the two. So we're not doing one or the 
 other, but with this offset and 
 amplitude combination. So if we have our 
 offset at one, we're just outputting a 
 value of one for every particle. But as 
 we start moving up, we're getting 
 different values added in there. And 
 then that's feeding back into the 
 system. If we turn up that period, 
 if we even turn it up really high, 
 you'll see that that kind of affects 
 different parts of the point system in a 
 more obvious way. 
 And so you can kind of tweak all these 
 parameters to get something that you 
 really like. 
 Going to maneuver this twist down a bit. 
 And I'm going to play with this noise a 
 little bit more. 
 Okay. And you could think about adding 
 attractors in or any of that kind of 
 stuff. we've looked at previously. Um, 
 basically working with the point data 
 and then you get some interesting 
 outputs. 
 Okay, I'm liking that. The next thing I 
 want to show you is we could add in, for 
 example, trails for certain particles 
 here. And I think that's a really 
 interesting kind of effect to add in as 
 well. But what I'm going to suggest is 
 because there are a large number of 
 points here. Uh we're going to filter 
 that. 
 So I'm going to take this into a delete 
 that isn't going to be part of my chain. 
 This will be a separate section. And 
 then a null. 
 On my delete, what I'm going to do is 
 I'm going to go to the thin tab and I'll 
 turn on enabled. 
 And I'm just going to drag that up 
 really quite high just so we have a few 
 of these points available. 
 And two things that we could do. One is 
 we could add in a proximity. 
 And this is a fun effect where we can 
 basically connect things based on how 
 close together they are. And in this 
 instance, we might have to turn this up 
 quite high. 
 I'm going to add in 
 an out for this so we can add this in a 
 little bit later. 
 Let's pop this here 
 and then merge them together. 
 Let's just see what this looks like on 
 its own. 
 And what we can see here is that 
 basically for this in terms of the 
 proximity it's not going to visualize 
 those lines even if they're very very 
 big. So in this case what we would do is 
 we would create 
 another geo 
 and I want to use a line renderer on 
 that geo. 
 And there we go. So we can see those 
 lines coming in. And if we add in 
 that sort again, we can see those lines. 
 Added into the mix. 
 Might be interesting actually if we went 
 back to our main pop and deleted a few 
 of these as well. So let's go into this 
 thin random. 
 If you do alter things at this stage, 
 important to remember to just repulse 
 your network 
 because 
 until you reset that feedback loop, 
 these changes are sort of just adding 
 iteratively in that feedback loop. Like 
 you can see the colors kind of all over 
 the place. So just reset. 
 So the main point cloud has been thinned 
 out. Let's go back into our FX. 
 Let's 
 turn this down a little bit. Put some 
 more. 
 Okay, that's a nice effect. 
 We can see that the color has sort of 
 been taken from that point cloud and 
 it's applied to those lines. But let's 
 go into the line and edit some stuff. 
 So, underline will change the color 
 for the near and the far. So, there we 
 go. We're now getting that full bright 
 color, 
 which is pretty cool. And then what you 
 can also do is you can go in and you can 
 alter the width, near, and far. So, 
 let's do like one and one. And finally, 
 if you really want to, you can go in and 
 take a look at some of the attributes 
 that you might have access to. 
 So let's say we're going to scale it by 
 the color for whatever reason. You can 
 get these interesting effects or if you 
 have like a particular size parameter 
 that you want to use. So this is one 
 option. And then the other option that I 
 wanted to show you is this trail. Again 
 I'm going to create another out. 
 And again, I'll have a delete because we 
 don't want to have lots and lots of 
 these particles trailing. Good idea to 
 save at this point because sometimes 
 things glitch. And 
 let's drag this up so we have fewer 
 particles. And I'm going to drag this 
 into a trail. 
 And because we have all of the same 
 attributes on all of these trail 
 particles, what we should be able to see 
 when we plug it in to our second out 
 and then when we merge the two. 
 So this is actually out three. Plug that 
 into the null there. 
 Let's reset. 
 There might be a lot going on here. 
 Okay, for the time being I'm just going 
 to disable this proximity just so we can 
 look at this other effect. 
 Very, very nice. And now let's take a 
 look at these trails. So, we can see 
 that the trails have been instanced. 
 Let's maybe make a few more of them. 
 Yeah, that's super nice. 
 It doesn't like when I move around, but 
 once I have kind of set that off, it's 
 it's quite stable. And now this should 
 now this should if it's not going to 
 crash on me respond to all of the same 
 controls as this over thing here. So if 
 I change the splat size the trail has 
 that applied too. If I move that up to 
 something like three the trail gets 
 bigger. And if I change this alpha 
 threshold that affects the trail as 
 well. So, this is something that works 
 kind of really nicely um just for 
 playing around with these networks. And 
 again, use that thin random to sort of 
 make things either less detailed and 
 easier on your computer or more detailed 
 and uh potentially giving your computer 
 a really really hard time 
 like this where we can see it's um 
 definitely struggling. 
 That is a really cool effect though. 
 Again, you can change that uniform 
 scale. That's basically how much is 
 going to be revealed in the scene. Or 
 you can turn it up. Remember to repulse. 
 And let's turn up this thing random 
 again. 
 So, I will make these experiments 
 available on my Patreon under the 
 component tier. The core of this where 
 it's just the base gouge and splat pop, 
 you can access if you sign up for a free 
 member, but these experiments will be 
 under component. I hope you have fun 
 playing with these. And uh apologies for 
 not making more videos sooner. I had a 
 bad cold, so I'm just getting back into 
 this. So, also apologies if my voice is 
 a bit croaky and I've been snuffly, but 
 great to uh chat with you all and more 
 tutorials
